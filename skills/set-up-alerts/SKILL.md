# Set up alerts

The tools named below are on the Award Travel Finder MCP connector. If they are not available, tell the user to connect https://mcp.awardtravelfinder.com/mcp (setup: https://awardtravelfinder.com/developers/mcp).

> **Plan:** needs Premium: `list_standing_orders`, `list_hotel_bookings`, `monitor_hotel_price`, `create_standing_order`, `cancel_standing_order`. If the user is on the free plan, tell them before you call these tools, and use the free steps where the skill gives one.

## 1. Check what exists

- Call `list_route_monitors`, `list_standing_orders` and `list_hotel_bookings`.
- Do not create a duplicate. Offer `update_route_monitor` to change an existing one.

## 2. Pick the alert type

- Award seats on a route: `create_route_monitor` with origin, destination, cabin, earliest date, latest date, passengers and an optional points cap.
- Price drop on a booked hotel: `monitor_hotel_price`. Follow the hotel-price-drop-rebook skill if the booking is not saved.
- Anything recurring or open-ended (e.g. "every Sunday, check transfer bonuses for my currencies"): `create_standing_order`. Write its prompt as a full instruction that names the tools to run.
- A better seat on a booked flight: `fs_create_seat_alert`.

## 3. Check the booking window

- For dates more than 300 days away, call `get_award_release_window` and tell the user when seats open.

## 4. Confirm limits

- Free accounts get one route monitor. If the call returns a paywall, show the upgrade link it returns.

## Output format

A list of the alerts now active: type, what it watches, how often it checks, where alerts go (email). Offer to cancel with `cancel_route_monitor` or `cancel_standing_order`.
