# Award Travel Finder — Claude Code Plugin & MCP Server

Search award flight availability, compare loyalty programs, and find the best points redemptions from your AI assistant. This plugin connects to the [Award Travel Finder](https://awardtravelfinder.com) MCP server, which exposes 96 award-travel tools over a single hosted endpoint.

**Works with Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, ChatGPT, Grok, Antigravity, and any MCP-compatible client.**

## Quick install

### Claude Code plugin (recommended)

```
/plugin marketplace add AwardTravelFinder/mcp
/plugin install award-travel-finder
```

### Any other MCP client

Point your client at the endpoint:

```
https://mcp.awardtravelfinder.com/mcp
```

For clients that take a config file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "awardtravelfinder": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://mcp.awardtravelfinder.com/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Clients with native remote-MCP support (Cursor, Windsurf, ChatGPT developer mode, Grok custom connectors) can use the URL directly without `mcp-remote`.

Per-client setup guides: [awardtravelfinder.com/mcp](https://awardtravelfinder.com/mcp).

## Authentication

The server uses **OAuth 2.1** as the MCP spec describes. On your first tool call the client opens your browser to sign in — about 30 seconds, no card. There is no API key.

> **Do not set an `Authorization` or `X-API-Key` header.** API-key authentication was retired on 2026-06-07. A leftover static header overrides the OAuth token the client obtained, and every request then fails with 401 even though the sign-in appeared to succeed. If you followed an older version of these instructions, delete the `headers` block from your config.

A free account covers everyday trip planning. [Premium](https://awardtravelfinder.com/pricing) unlocks unlimited searches and every cabin.

## What you can do

Ask naturally — the bundled `award-travel` skill activates on its own when you mention award flights, points, miles, or an airline:

```
"Find business class from London to New York using Avios"
"Are there any award seats on Cathay Pacific HKG-LHR next month?"
"Which program has the cheapest business class to Tokyo?"
"How many Avios do I need for London to New York in business?"
```

Or use the slash commands:

```
/atf:search-flights BA LHR JFK 2026-06-15
/atf:compare-programs british-airways emirates
```

## Coverage

**27 airlines** can be searched one at a time with `search_availability`:

British Airways, Qatar Airways, Cathay Pacific, Virgin Atlantic, Iberia, Emirates, Qantas, Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, JetBlue, Frontier, Southwest, Delta, Japan Airlines, United, TAP Portugal, Cape Air, Icelandair, Condor, Aer Lingus, El Al, Turkish Airlines, ANA, Lufthansa, Air France, KLM, Etihad.

**9 of those** are in the `search_all_airlines` fan-out, which sweeps them together in one call: British Airways, Cathay Pacific, Virgin Atlantic, Iberia, Qatar Airways, Alaska Airlines, JetBlue, Frontier, Southwest. Award inventory is genuinely sparse, so a route with no results usually means no seats rather than a broken search.

**23 loyalty programs** have award-chart data via `get_program_rates`:

`british-airways`, `qatar-airways`, `singapore-airlines`, `cathay-pacific`, `emirates`, `etihad`, `flying-blue`, `aeroplan`, `turkish-airlines`, `ana`, `jetblue`, `jet2-emirates`, `virgin-atlantic`, `iberia`, `alaska-airlines`, `american-airlines`, `qantas`, `delta-skymiles`, `united`, `lifemiles`, `marriott-bonvoy`, `hilton-honors`, `hyatt`.

**4 hotel programs** for award nights: Marriott, Hilton, IHG, Hyatt.

Run `tools/list` against the endpoint for the full catalogue — it answers without authentication, so you can inspect the server before signing in.
